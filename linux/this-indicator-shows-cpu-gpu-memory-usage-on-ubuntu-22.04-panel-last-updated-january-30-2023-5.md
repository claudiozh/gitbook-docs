# üíª This Indicator Shows CPU, GPU, Memory Usage on Ubuntu 22.04 Panel Last updated: January 30, 2023 ‚Äî 5

There are several Gnome Shell extensions to display system resource usage in Ubuntu, but in this tutorial I‚Äôm going to introduce an indicator that works in not only _GNOME_, but also _Unity_, _MATE_, and _Budgie_ desktop environments.

It‚Äôs [Indicator-SysMonitor](https://github.com/fossfreedom/indicator-sysmonitor), a free and open-source applet developed by the leader of Ubuntu Budgie team.

With it, user can display the usage and/or temperature of the following system resource in top-panel:

* average CPU usage.
* NVIDIA GPU utilization.
* Memory usage.
* network upload/download speed.
* CPU, NVIDIA GPU temperature.
* Swap usage.
* Public IP address.

Most important is that user can customize the output, by setting which one or ones to display, in which order with which text. User just need to click the indicator on panel to open ‚ÄòPreferences‚Äô dialog from pop-down menu, and format the output code in ‚ÄòAdvanced‚Äô tab.
